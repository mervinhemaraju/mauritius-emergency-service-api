            <h2 class="subtitle">Privacy Policy</h2>

            <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
            <p>
                <b>We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any Personal Data.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mauritius Emergency Services app is designed with privacy as a core principle:
                <ul>
                    <li>No user accounts or registration required</li>
                    <li>No tracking or analytics</li>
                    <li>No cookies or persistent identifiers</li>
                    <li>No location data collection</li>
                    <li>No contact information stored</li>
                    <li>No usage statistics collected</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Data Sources</h4>
            <p>
                The Application displays information from two sources:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Emergency Contact Numbers:</b> Manually curated and maintained by the Developer. These are
                        publicly available contact numbers compiled from official sources and public directories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Cyclone Information:</b> Sourced from the Mauritius Meteorological Services website
                        (http://metservice.intnet.mu/current-cyclone.php). Our API fetches this publicly available data
                        and relays it to the Application for user convenience. We do not modify or alter this
                        information.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>How the Application Works</h4>
            <p>
                When you use the Application:
                <ol>
                    <li>The app connects to our API at https://mes.plagueworks.org/api</li>
                    <li>The API provides emergency contact numbers (stored on our servers)</li>
                    <li>The API fetches current cyclone information from the Mauritius Meteorological Services website
                    </li>
                    <li>This information is displayed to you in the app</li>
                    <li>When you make a call, your device's native phone functionality is used</li>
                </ol>
                <b>No data about your usage, calls, or interactions is sent back to us or stored anywhere.</b>
            </p>

            <h4>Permissions</h4>
            <p>
                The Application may request the following permissions:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Phone/Call Permission:</b> Required to initiate emergency calls directly from the app. This
                        permission does not allow us to access your call history, contacts, or any other information.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Internet Access:</b> Required to fetch emergency contact numbers and cyclone information from
                        our API.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Data Storage</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>On Your Device:</b> The app may temporarily cache data (emergency numbers, cyclone alerts)
                        locally on your device for offline access. This data remains on your device only and is never
                        transmitted to us.</li>
                    <li><b>On Our Servers:</b> We maintain a database of emergency contact numbers for Mauritius. This
                        database contains no user information—only publicly available emergency service contact details.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
            <p>
                The Application relies on:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Our API (mes.plagueworks.org):</b> Hosted and maintained by the Developer</li>
                    <li><b>Mauritius Meteorological Services:</b> For cyclone information (we have no control over their
                        website or data)</li>
                </ul>
                We do not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
            </p>

            <h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
            <p>
                The Application does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The
                Service is available to all users without any data collection.
            </p>

            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>
                Since we do not collect Personal Data, there is no user data at risk. However, we implement security
                best practices for our API and servers to ensure the integrity and availability of emergency contact
                information.
            </p>

                    <li>You can uninstall the Application at any time with no residual data concerns</li>
                    <li>No account deletion is necessary as no accounts are created</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>

                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Application or legal
                requirements. We will notify users of any material changes by:

                <b>Emergency Contact Numbers:</b> We manually maintain emergency contact numbers using publicly

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cyclone Information:</b> Cyclone data is sourced directly from the Mauritius Meteorological Services
